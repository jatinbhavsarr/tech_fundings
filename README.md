# Tech Fundings: Data Dashboard for Investment Analysis

## Executive Summary
The Tech Fundings project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize investment trends in the technology sector. By integrating funding data across various companies, industries, and funding stages, this dashboard helps investors and startups track trends, identify high-growth opportunities, and optimize investment strategies based on historical performance.

## Business Problem
Tech investors face challenges in identifying promising startups and tracking emerging trends in the tech industry. There is a lack of comprehensive tools that provide insights into funding patterns, investment stages, and sector-specific performance. Without clear visualizations, investors struggle to make informed decisions on where to allocate resources and which sectors to target.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly platform that consolidates information about available funding options for technology projects, enabling users to easily search, filter, and access relevant funding opportunities.

## Tools I Use
- **Power BI**: For visualizing and creating interactive dashboards.
- **DAX**: For performing advanced calculations and generating dynamic insights.
- **SQL Server**: For querying and extracting funding data from a large database of investments.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and integration from multiple sources.

## Portfolio Contents
- **Power BI Dashboard (.pbix file)**: The main interactive dashboard file.
- **Documentation (PDF)**: A detailed guide explaining the dashboard features and usage.
- **Presentation (PPT)**: A summary presentation of key findings and insights derived from the analysis.

## Project Highlights
- 3,221 companies were funded across 73 countries in 141 sectors, showcasing broad global participation.
- Total funding amount reached $205 billion, with an average funding amount of $57.56 million per company.
- In 2020, funding peaked in Q2 & Q3 and gradually declined toward Q4.
- In 2021, funding peaked in Q2 only and gradually declined toward Q3.
- Q4 experienced the lowest funding activity, indicating seasonal slowdowns.
- B2B Software, Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence were top-funded sectors.
- Overall, funding amounts spiked in May and August, with a sharp decline in October–December.

## Suggestions
To enhance the dashboard's effectiveness:
- Consider adding user authentication for personalized experiences.
- Incorporate advanced filtering options for searching by genre or investment size.
- Enhance data visualization features to provide deeper insights into funding patterns.

## Challenges
A key challenge in the Tech Fundings project was ensuring data accuracy and consistency when querying funding information. Frequent updates in funding details required effective data validation in SQL, while creating dynamic Power BI reports that reflect real-time updates necessitated a robust connection to avoid discrepancies.

## Learnings
- Enhanced skills in DAX for complex data analysis, including time-based calculations and sector-specific metrics.
- Gained experience in Power Query for transforming and cleaning large datasets from multiple sources.
- Learned how to create actionable and clear data visualizations that support investment decision-making.
- Improved ability to identify key trends and patterns in large-scale financial data.
- Gained expertise in optimizing Power BI dashboards to handle large datasets while maintaining performance.
